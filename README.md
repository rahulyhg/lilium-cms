# Lilium CMS #

Lilium is a lightning-fast, online Content Management System built with node.js, without express. Its power resides in the cache engine running behind Lilium, which reduces CPU usage, RAM and database access. 

Interpreting its own simple language, Lilium used PML (Petal Markup Language) to create the templates and generate the served files. PML is user friendly, ressemble HTML and makes it easy for new developers or web designers to customize their very own themes (gardens). 

### Installation guide ###

All NodeJS plugins are to be installed, and are documented in the package file so you can simply run *npm install* in the root folder where you setup Lilium. 

### NPM or GIT ###

The CMS will be available on NPM and GitHub once ready to be released as a beta version.
